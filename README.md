RouteSetter

RouteSetter is a Derail Valley mod that allows you to automatically set a route to a desired destination.
Installation

Install this mod using UMM (Unity Mod Manager).
How to Use

    Make sure youâ€™ve visited a locomotive at least once since your last load, sleep, or fast travel.

    Equip your comms radio in hand.

    Select your desired destination from the list.

The route will be automatically set if possible.
Notes

    Tracks with numbers before names (e.g., "01 - Station") are station tracks that don't have a specific backend identifier. These may be unrouteable.

    Routes that require a Y-turn (i.e., reversing at a junction) will not work, due to in-game limitations.
